            Giorno is a teenage boy of average height, a slim yet muscular
            build, and is far smaller in stature than previous JoJos. He has
            golden hair of moderate length tied back in a short, braided tail,
            with his bangs curled into three distinctive oversized ringlets
            arranged in a row over his forehead. His hair was originally black
            and unkempt, barely going past his neck, but it transformed upon
            awakening his Stand. His eyes, especially present in earlier
            depictions, sharpen at the end similar to his father's. He possesses
            a star-shaped birthmark on his left shoulder.
          </p>
          <p class="text-base text-[#4B5563]" style="text-align: justify">
            Giorno wears a two-piece suit with a checkered coat tail and several
            ornate features, including wing-shaped emblems on the collar and a
            heart-shaped opening in the chest area. The most distinctive feature
            on his suit is the three ladybug emblems located on either side of
            his chest and directly below his zipper, matching the appearance of
            his Stand. Later on, his shoes also have the same ladybug emblem on
            them. He wears a small stud in each ear.
